This repository contains shell scripts for docker.

#### WARNING: These instructions are incomplete. Consider them as notes quickly drafted on a napkin rather than proper documentation!

I have been using some of these for days, months, or years and just now uploading them. I need to complete some cleanup before it is shareable and documented . . .

This repository contains shell scripts for RaspBerry pi.

 * [dockerd-configuration-options](https://github.com/BradleyA/docker-scripts/tree/master/dockerd-configuration-options)

## System OS script tested

    Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS

## Install

To install, change directory to the location you want to download the scripts. Use git to pull or clone these scripts into the directory. If you do not have git then enter; "sudo apt-get install git". On the github page of this script use the "HTTPS clone URL" with the 'git clone' command.

    git clone https://github.com/BradleyA/docker-scripts
    cd docker-scripts

#### Design Principles
 * Have a simple setup process and a minimal learning curve
 * Be usable as non-root - [failed]
 * Be easy to install and configure
